A brief description of the project is:

Interaction with a robot in a gesture-based manner. It involves gesture detection and recognition with a depth camera posed on a mobile platform. A NAO robot may be used to perform object manipulation. Example case: a person pointing an object which the robot has to find and maybe grasp.
